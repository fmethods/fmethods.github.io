<p>This special issue is devoted to the scope of the Third Workshop on Synthesis, SYNT 2014 (see <a href="http://vsl2014.at/synt">http://vsl2014.at/synt</a>). SYNT 2014 was co-located with CAV in the scope of the Vienna Summer of Logic 2014 and was devoted to bringing together researchers from different research areas who work on the quickly growing field of synthesis. The special issue will cover all topics related to synthesis, which includes, but is not limited to,</p>
<ul>
<li>algorithms and tools for software synthesis and reactive (discrete-time, timed, hybrid, ...) synthesis,</li>
<li>specification languages and optimization in synthesis,</li>
<li>complexity and impossibility results for synthesis,</li>
<li>case studies of software or hardware synthesis,</li>
<li>synthesis in systems biology, and</li>
<li>connections between verification and synthesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission to this special issue is completely open and not limited to participants of the SYNT 2014 workshop. We expect original articles (typically 15-30 pages), which present high-quality contributions that have not been previously published in a journal and are not concurrently submitted to any other peer reviewed venue. All submissions should include some theoretical contribution to the area of synthesis. Extended versions of contributions previously published in proceedings need to contain significant new material and should be accompanied by a short description of the extension.</p>
<p>The submission system will open in January 2015 (see 
<a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/theoretical+computer+science/journal/236">http://www.springer.com/computer/theoretical+computer+science/journal/236</a> and then click on "Submit Online").</p></div>
