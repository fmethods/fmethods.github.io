<h2>Sumit Gulwani: Programming by Examples applied to Data Manipulation</h2>

<p>Programming by Examples (PBE) involves synthesizing intended programs in an
underlying domain-specific language from example based specifications (Espec).
In this talk, I will formalize our notion of Espec and describe some principles
behind designing appropriate domain-specific languages.  A key technical
challenge in PBE is to search for programs that are consistent with the Espec
provided by the user. We have developed a divide-and-conquer based search
paradigm that leverages deductive rules and version space algebras to achieve
real time efficiency. Another technical challenge in PBE is to resolve the
ambiguity that is inherent in the Espec. We use machine learning based ranking
techniques to predict an intended program within a set of programs that are
consistent with the Espec. We also leverage active-learning based user
interaction models to help resolve ambiguity in the Espec. In this talk, I will
demo few PBE technologies (FlashFill, FlashExtract, and FlashRelate) that have
been developed using these principles for the domain of data manipulation.
These technologies are useful for data scientists who typically spend 80% of
their time cleaning data, and for 99% of those end users who do not know
programming.</p>

<h2>Aditya Nori: Probabilistic Programming: Algorithms, Implementation and Synthesis</h2>

<p>Recent years have seen a huge shift in the kind of programs that most
programmers write. Programs are increasingly data driven instead of being
algorithm driven. They use various forms of machine learning techniques to
build models from data, for the purpose of decision making. Indeed, search
engines, social networks, speech recognition, computer vision, and applications
that use data from clinical trials, biological experiments, and sensors, are
all examples of data driven programs.</p>

<p>We use the term "probabilistic programs" to refer to data driven
programs that are written using higher-level abstractions. Though they
span various application domains, all data driven programs have to deal
with uncertainty in the data, and face similar issues in design,
debugging, optimization and deployment.</p>

<p>In this talk, we describe connections this research area called
"Probabilistic Programming" has with programming languages and software
engineering --- this includes language design, static and dynamic
analysis of programs, and program synthesis. We survey current state of
the art and speculate on promising directions for future research.</p>
