</ul>

<h2>Scope and Topics of Interest</h2>

<p>The workshop aims to bring together researchers interested
in the broad area of synthesis of computing systems. The
workshop aims to foster the development of frontier
techniques in automating the development of computing
systems and is inclusive in its interpretation of the term
synthesis:</p>
</ul>
<li>Contributions of interest may include algorithms,
complexity and decidability analysis, as well as
reproducible heuristics, implemented tools, and experimental
evaluation.</li>

<li>Application domains include software, hardware, embedded,
and cyberphysical systems. Computation models include
functional, reactive, hybrid and timed systems.
Identifying, formalizing, and evaluating synthesis in
particular application domains is encouraged.</li>

<li>Of interest are approaches that explore alternative
development methods, as well as approaches that improve upon the
automation of design, compilation, and optimization
techniques currently in widespread use.</li>

<li>All appropriate underlying methods are of interest,
including above formal methods and techniques that build
upon computer-aided verification, but also machine learning
and data mining techniques. All formalizable forms of specifications of
potential practical interest are considered, including
contracts, temporal logic specifications, quantitative
objectives, partial systems, and (possibly symbolic) input/output examples.</li>

<li>Of great interest is understanding and productively making
use of relationships between synthesis and related topics
such as repair, fault localization, testing, discovery (synthesis) of inductive 
invariants,
parameter optimization, constraints
solving, theorem proving (including SMT, superposition-based, inductive, and  
higher-order theorem proving, as well as automated generation of lemmas and 
knowledge discovery).
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

<p>
Submitted papers must be original and unpublished.
Papers accepted for presentation at the workshop appeared in previous
years in the
<a href="http://www.eptcs.org/">Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science</a> series; hence, <a href="http://info.eptcs.org/">submissions must be prepared in LaTeX using
the EPTCS macro package</a> (<a href="./eptcsstyle.zip">author preparation kit zip file</a>).  Submitted papers should be <strong>4 to 16 pages long in EPTCS
style excluding references</strong>; within those page limits the
authors should use as many pages as is appropriate for their
contribution.</p>

<p>The submission of workshop papers is 
  <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=synt2015">through this link</a>
.</p>

<p>
The final pre-proceedings version is due on <strong>30 June 2015</strong>. You have <strong>up to 25 pages</strong> in the EPTCS format for your final version.
Please use your easychair account to upload the pre-proceedings version of your paper.
This version will be made available to workshop participants.
</p>

<p>
The final post-proceedings version will be due on <strong>20 August 2015</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Note: revised versions of selected papers is expected to appear in a special issue of the
journal Acta Informatica (<a href="http://link.springer.com/journal/236/51/3">an example of a past special issue</a>).</p>
