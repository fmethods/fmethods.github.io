                      4th Workshop on Synthesis

                   San Francisco, CA, USA, July 18, 2015

		       co-located with CAV 2015

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The workshop aims to bring together researchers interested
in the broad area of synthesis of computing systems. The
workshop aims to foster the development of frontier
techniques in automating the development of computing
systems and is inclusive in its interpretation of the term
synthesis:

* Contributions of interest may include algorithms,
complexity and decidability analysis, as well as
reproducible heuristics, implemented tools, and experimental
evaluation.

* Application domains include software, hardware, embedded,
and cyberphysical systems. Computation models include
functional, reactive, hybrid and timed systems.
Identifying, formalizing, and evaluating synthesis in
particular application domains is encouraged.

* Of interest are both approaches that explore alternative
development methods and approaches that improve upon the
automation of design, compilation, and optimization
techniques currently in widespread use.  

* All appropriate underlying methods are of interest,
including above formal methods and techniques that build
upon computer-aided verification, but also machine learning
techniques. All formalizable forms of specifications of
potential practical interest are considered, including
contracts, temporal logic specifications, quantitative
objectives, partial systems, and input/output examples.

* Of great interest is understanding and making productive use of
relationships between synthesis and related topics such as repair,
fault localization, testing, discovery of inductive invariants,
parameter optimization, constraints solving, theorem proving
(including SMT, superposition-based, inductive, and higher-order
theorem proving). 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Submitted papers must be original and unpublished. Papers accepted
for presentation at the workshop appeared in previous years in the Electronic 
Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science series; hence,
submissions must be prepared in LaTeX using the EPTCS macro
package. Submitted papers should be 4 to 16 
pages long in EPTCS style excluding references; within those page
limits the authors should use as many pages as is appropriate for
their contribution. 

Extended versions of selected papers are expected to appear in a
special issue of the journal Acta Informatica.
