<h1>SYNT Workshops</h1>

<p>The idea of synthesis, i.e., the process of automatically computing implementations from their specifications, has recently gained a lot of momentum in the contexts of software engineering and reactive system design. While it is widely believed that, due to complexity/undecidability issues, synthesis cannot completely replace manual engineering, it can assist the process of designing the intricate pieces of code that most programmers find challenging, or help with orchestrating tasks in reactive environments.</p>

<p>This workshop aims at bringing together and providing an open platform for researchers interested in synthesis. Research on synthesis exists well alongside conferences on formal methods and verification, such as CAV, which aim at improving the reliability of systems. Driven by the vast potential for practical applications of synthesis, we aim at fostering scientific exchange not only within the areas of software and reactive synthesis, but also between them.</p>

<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>

<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>algorithms and tools for software synthesis and reactive (discrete-time, timed, hybrid, ...) synthesis</li>
<li>specification languages and optimization in synthesis</li>
<li>complexity and impossibility results for synthesis</li>
<li>case studies of software or hardware synthesis</li>
<li>connections between verification and synthesis</li>
</ul>
